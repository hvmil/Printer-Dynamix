Setup For PrinterDynamix on Windows

Prerequisites:

1) Xampp -- https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
-> Make sure to run the installation as admin and install to c:\Xampp
-> Only really need Apache, MySQL, PHP and PHPMyAdmin

2) Python 3.10+  -- Earlier versions of Python3 may work, but haven't been tested.

Easiest way to get this is to just type python3 at a command prompt. If it's not on the system,
Windows will direct you to a Microsoft Store page. From there you can just click the 'Get' button.

If you install from the official Python site/repos, make sure that the python binary is in your SYSTEM PATH.

3) Python Modules - lxml, bs4, mysql.connector, re, requests

Run an admin command prompt and the command is this:

pip3 install lxml bs4 mysql.connector

Also made a quick script for this -- Install-PythonModules.cmd (run as admin)

4) Git SCM

https://git-scm.com/

I prefer to use command-line git instead of the GUI. If you choose to use the CLI version,
make sure to select the option to add to PATH. Not sure if this is necessary when using the GUI.


5) PrinterDynamix Git Repo

git clone https://github.com/Zed-Fermon/PrinterDynamix.git

* I like to separate working directory from my git directory. This means that at any point in development,
I can easily revert one or many files back to the git version. I recommend cloning to desktop or documents.
